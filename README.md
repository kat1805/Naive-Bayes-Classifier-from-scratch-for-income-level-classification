# Naive-Bayes-Classifier-from-scratch-for-income-level-classification
Building and implementing a Naive Bayes classifier from scratch to classify the income level of a given indivdual


Overview

In the UCI machine learning repository (Asuncion and Newman, 2007), the Adult database was ex- tracted from the census bureau database found at http://www.census.gov/ftp/pub/DES/ www/welcome.html. In adult.csv, we have extracted the records and attributes for assign- ment1.1 Thefileadult.csvcontainsintotal1,000samples/instanceseachofthemhas11attributes below and a class label to indicate whether the income is over 50K or not.

The question mark "?" indicates missing value.
This project aims to classify the individual as per the income levels using a Naive Bayes classifier. 

There are only two values of class labels - 

 **c1 ="<=50K" and c2 =">50K"**
